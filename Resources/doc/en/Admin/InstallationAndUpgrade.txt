# Installation

To install PostCalendar simply unpack the distribution inside your Zikula modules 
directory. This will create the ./modules/PostCalendar directory and should contain 
all the files of the distribution.

Now, enter the administration portion of your Zikula site:

* Select MODULES Administration
* Find the PostCalendar entry in the list
* Click INSTALL (the green arrow) 

You should now have a fully functioning PostCalendar installation.

You'll want to enter your site's Administration and configure PostCalendar before 
you start to enter events. The installation will set defaults for the calendar so 
that it works, but in order to better suit your needs, it's best to change these 
as early as possible.

# Upgrade

## Upgrading from old versions

PostCalendar 8.0.x supports upgrades from version 7.0.x and newer. If you are using 
an older version, you must upgrade to version 7.0.1 first before upgrading to 8.0.0.
You can download earlier versions at

https://github.com/craigh/PostCalendar/downloads

If you are upgrading from PostNuke it may be painful :-) I suggest upgrading Zikula 
to 1.1.2 via the migration distribution, then upgrading PostCalendar to 5.5.3. 
Then upgrade Zikula to 1.2.3 and upgrade PostCalendar to 6.1.0. Then upgrade to 
the most recent version of Zikula and PostCalendar 7.0.1, then PostCalendar 8.0.0.

Backup your database before continuing with the upgrade.

NOTICE: PostCalendar v6.0.0 could take a very long time to upgrade because it migrates 
every event to the new categories system as well as making several other database 
changes. Please be patient as it completes the upgrade process, it could take several 
minutes depending on the number of events you have.

## Upgrading from 7.0.x to 8.0.0

To upgrade PostCalendar you should first make a backup of your current Database 
tables (using a tool like phpMyAdmin) and also backup your current PostCalendar 
installation. This will be useful in the event an upgrade does not work for you.

Next, remove the existing PostCalendar files completely (if they are there). This 
is important because there are many extra files in the old installation that should 
be removed.

Next, unpack the PostCalendar distribution inside your Zikula modules directory. 
This will create the modules/PostCalendar directory and place all the necessary 
files there. (note: if you downloaded your module from the Zikula Extensions database, 
then you should unpack your module from your Zikula root directory.)

Using the standard Zikula Module upgrade method, upgrade your module.

* Select MODULES Administration
* Click the upgrade link. 

NOTICE: PostCalendar v8.0.0 could take a very long time to upgrade because it
has to update every event with new information. Please be patient as it completes
the upgrade process.

Please note that the use of category colors has changed in PC 8.0.0. You may need 
to adjust your category and text colors for their new usage.

## Trouble Shooting

7.0.x to 8.0.0  -> Duplicates in categories_mapobj

Postcalendar 8.0.0 no longer uses the categories_mapobj table. All entries are migrated 
to postcalender_calenderevent_category. In some old installations it is possible to have 
some duplicates in categories_mapobj. You can check this with the following sql:

  SELECT obj_id, reg_id, category_id 
  FROM categories_mapobj WHERE modname = 'PostCalendar' AND tablename = 'postcalendar_events' 
  group by obj_id, reg_id, category_id 
  having count(*) > 1";

If during the upgrade you get the error:

  SQLSTATE[23000]: Integrity constraint violation: 1062 Duplicate entry '??-????-?' for key 'cat_unq'
  
Check your entries in the table and clean up your data. 

As workaround you can change the SQL in the Upgrade Script. Be careful and test the results.
In PostCalendar/lib/Postcalendar/Installer.php look for the following INSERT sql statement:

  $sqls[] = "INSERT INTO postcalendar_calendarevent_category (entityId, registryId, categoryId) 
    SELECT obj_id, reg_id, category_id FROM categories_mapobj 
    WHERE modname = 'PostCalendar' AND tablename = 'postcalendar_events';

Extend this with a GROUP BY:

  $sqls[] = "INSERT INTO postcalendar_calendarevent_category (entityId, registryId, categoryId) 
    SELECT obj_id, reg_id, category_id FROM categories_mapobj 
    WHERE modname = 'PostCalendar' AND tablename = 'postcalendar_events' 
    GROUP BY obj_id, reg_id, category_id";
