## PostCalendar v8.0.0 Category Usage

### Categorization now required

As of v8.0.0, PostCalendar now requires the use of categorization. All checks for 
'enablecategorization' have been removed and it is assumed they are in use.

### Utilizing Categories in a New Installation of PostCalendar

On install, PostCalendar will create a main category called 'PostCalendar' and one 
subcategory called 'Events'. The category will have a property name of 'Main'. The 
Events subcategory will have an attribute called 'color' and a value of '#99ccff' 
(light blue).

### Adding New Categories & Subcategories to PostCalendar

If you wish to add more subcategories, you can do so easily using the Categories 
module. Be sure to choose 'PostCalendar' as the parent category and add a color 
attribute with an appropriate hexadecimal value.

One may also create a new category and link it to PostCalendar. This will allow 
you to categorize PostCalendar events in multiple areas. Simply create a new Category, 
then using the categories registry, select the following values

`PostCalendar | CalendarEvent | <choose a name> | <your new category name>`

Be sure to create appropriate subcategories. PostCalendar will not associate colors 
with secondary (non 'Main') subcategories, so there is no need to create color attributes.

To remove a parent category from PostCalendar, simply delete the associated entry 
in the category registry and it will no longer be associated with the module.

### Using Colors in Categories

One can assign colors for any category utilized in PostCalendar. This color is used 
to provide a visual cue to the user. Do so by creating a _color_ attribute and give 
it a [hexadecimal value][link1] (including the hash symbol) e.g. '#cccccc'. If you 
do not assign a color to a category a default color of '#eeeeee' will be used.

*Note that the attribute names **must** be in English (as above).*

### Using Global Categories in PostCalendar

If you want to use the same categories in PostCalendar that you are using in other 
modules (the Global categories or another), you are free to do so. Create a new 
category registry entry with the following settings:

`PostCalendar | CalendarEvent | Main | __SYSTEM__/Modules/Global`

*note: these settings assign the 'Main' property name to the global categories. 
If you do this, delete the old PostCalendar 'Main' reference or convert it to a 
secondary category.*

Be sure to remember to add a 'color' attribute to each of the global categories 
to take advantage of that feature in PostCalendar.

### Multi-Category Filter

Multi-Category filtering is possible using the multi-select in the filter.

### Category Permissions

Category-based permissions became available for the first time in PostCalendar 
v7.0. Please see `Permissions.txt` of the documentation for more information.
