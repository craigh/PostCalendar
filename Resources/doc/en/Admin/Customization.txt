## PostCalendar v8.0.0 Customization: Overriding PostCalendar Templates and Stylesheets

### Overriding Stylesheets (css)

This is the easiest and most quickly beneficial customization you can make to your 
installation of PostCalendar. If the only thing you want to change is colors, this 
is all you need to do. You do need to understand css a little. The colors are clearly 
labeled in the stylesheet.

*   Create a directory in your theme `themes/<yourthemename>/style/PostCalendar/`
*   Copy `modules/PostCalendar/style/style.css` to `themes/<yourthemename>/style/PostCalendar/style.css`

Now, you can modify the PostCalendar stylesheet in your theme all you like. 
([make sure your changes will be seen immediately][link1])

### Overriding Templates

This is a bit more complicated and will require a working knowledge of Smarty and 
HTML. In order to override a template, you must make an entry in your 
`config/tempalte_overrides.yml` file and then put a copy in that location and
modify your copy.

### Warning

When you upgrade PostCalendar, you have to remember to remove your overrides and 
then check them to see if they are still valid before using them with a new version.
