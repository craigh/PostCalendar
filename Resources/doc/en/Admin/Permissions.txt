## PostCalendar v8.0.0 Permissions settings

As of version 7 (and 6.2), PostCalendar supports _category-based_ permissions and 
_event-based_ permissions.

In order to deny access to unregistered users to a particular event, you can use 
a permission setting like so:

`Unregistered | PostCalendar::Event | <event title>::<event id> | No access`

*example:*

`Unregistered | PostCalendar::Event | My Birthday::247 | No access`

In order to deny access to unregistered users to all events in a certain category, 
you can use a permission setting like so:

`Unregistered | Categories::Category | <Category ID>:: | No access`

*example:*

`Unregistered | Categories::Category | 93:: | No access`

In order to allow all registered users to submit event, you can use a permission 
setting like so:

`Users| PostCalendar:: | .* | Add access`

You can restrict this to less users by choosing a different group.

In order to allow a subgroup to administrate PostCalendar events, you can use a 
permission setting like so:

`CalendarAdmins | PostCalendar:: | .* | Delete access`

Be sure to define the group and assign members as appropriate.

*Remember that the _order_ in which your permission 
settings occur (bottom to top) is _crucial_! *
