#### TimeIt Migration

PostCalendar can import events from TimeIt module. To perform the import, 
PostCalendar must detect a TimeIt database table named "[prefix]TimeIt_events" 
(note case). Here, you will find information on whether the TimeIt module table 
was detected and what exact table name was searched for. If your TimeIt table 
exists but has different name than the one specified below, rename it and click 
"Check again". Once this detects a table, you can complete the migration by
clicking the link in the admin menu bar. See the TimeIt_Imports.txt file for
more information.

## Event Default Values

The values entered here will be automatically entered in the new event form. They can be changed there if needed again, but this provides a good start to quick event creation.

## NOTES:
* Three standard choices are prepared. If choosing to customize it is required that *all three* types of formatting be entered.
* The new NavBar uses jQuery and jQuery-UI which are included with Zikula 1.3.3+. The old style (with or without icons) uses Prototype
  and Scriptaculous. Load times are not dramatically different between these two options unless your theme or a block on your calendar
  page is also loading the other library. The new jQuery method is preferred.
