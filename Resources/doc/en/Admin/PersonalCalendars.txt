## PostCalendar v8.0.0 Personal Calendars

PostCalendar allows the administrator to define one Zikula group that is allowed 
to have personal calendars. First, use the Group manager to create a group and add 
whomever you wish to that group. Then select that group in the PostCalendar settings 
admin panel. If you wish, you can use pre-existing groups like 'Admins' or 'Users' 
(use of Users is discouraged). One can also select 'no group' which disables this 
feature for everyone.

If you choose a group other than 'no group', an additional selectbox will be added 
to the PostCalendar header that will allow the users in that group to choose to 
filter their display by event type. In addition, admins (only) will be able to select 
any user with personal events and view those events.

Private events are indicated by a 'lock' icon in the user-display.
