### Hooks

**Please note: this information applies to PostCalendar v8.0.0+ only.**

PostCalendar hooks have been updated in version 8.0.0 and require a refactoring
of provided plugin classes. If your module supplies a plugin, please be sure to
update it as outlined here.

PostCalendar provides create, update and delete hooks that can be utilized and
customized by any modules that wishes to create a calendar event along with
their own item creation. PostCalendar ships with an example of this
technology: _News_ (and _Generic_). You can find these examples as follows:

    modules/PostCalendar/lib/PostCalendar/PostCalendarEvent/News.php
    modules/PostCalendar/lib/PostCalendar/PostCalendarEvent/Generic.php

Each of these functions _could_ (and should) be located in their respective module's own
directory. Create the following directory structure with your module:

    modules/<yourmodulename>/lib/<yourmodulename>/PostCalendarEvent/<yourmodulename>.php

within this file, create a class which extends the base class like so:

    class <yourmodulename>_PostCalendarEvent_<yourmodulename> extends PostCalendar_PostCalendarEvent_AbstractBase

within that class, you must create at least the following _required_ method:

    public function makeEvent()

Again, please see the PostCalendar module for examples.

Your makeEvent method must set the following properties that will form the event:

        title
        hometext
        eventStart
        eventEnd
        sharing

**Use the provided Setter methods to set the property values.**

There are additional class properties that can be set if you wish. Please see
the Base class for additional information.
