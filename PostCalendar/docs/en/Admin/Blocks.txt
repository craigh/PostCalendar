## PostCalendar v7.0.0 Blocks

### Calendar

This is the main Calendar block for PostCalendar. This can display any or all of three main elements:

1.  Small 'month view' navigation calendar
2.  Today's events
3.  Upcoming events

One can also limit the display to one category by selecting it in the block administration. Select 'all categories' to not limit the display.

One can choose to hide the "Today's Events" portion of the block if there are no events for today.

Optionally display a submit and search link in the block and modify the amount of events to display in the upcoming events area.

The block becomes more useful if the 'popup' or 'hover' options are selected in the admin settings.

### Featured Event

The featured event block allows a site admin to call attention to a specific event in a block. The block requires the event ID to function. In addition, one can optionally display a daily countdown to that event and also optionally hide the block when the event 'expires'. *note: the block is not deleted it is simply hidden.* An admin-only notice will be displayed if a featured event block has been hidden.

### Past Events

The past events block is useful as an archive of events as they have already passed. This is especially useful if you are using PostCalendar in *hooks mode* to archive your News stories or User registrations.

Similar to the Upcoming Events block, one can filter the block to display only events in a certain Category (e.g. News). One can also limit the number of months into the past that events are displayed.
